# Introduction

### Hmm... so what exactly is Cypiripi?

Cypiripi is a tool for exact genotyping of CYP2D6 using High Throughput Sequencing Data. A paper describing the algorithm is about to be published in [ISMB 2015][3].

### How do I get Cypiripi?

Just clone our repository to get the latest binary:

	git clone https://github.com/sfu-compbio/cypiripi.git

> **DISCLAIMER** : Due to the CPLEX licencing restrictions and fact that CPLEX is statically linked to the binary, this software is only available for **ACADEMIC** use. It is **strictly forbidden** to use it for any commercial purpose, unless explicitly allowed in writing by the authors. This might change in the future, though. Thank you!

### How do I run Cypiripi?

Ideally, just invoke `cypiripi.py` with the following options:

	python cypiripi.py --fasta reference --fastq [mygenome.fastq] --cov [coverage]

where:

-	`--fasta` is the prefix of a pre-processed CYP2D6 reference. One reference is already provided in the package, and it is named `CYP2D6`.
-	`--fastq` is your **interleaved** and paired `.fastq` file
-	`--cov` is the coverage per chromosome. E.g. for 40x sample, `--cov` should be 20.

Please check next section for more details and requirements.
